== pdxruby.org development todo ==

Notes:

1) If you complete one of these, please remove it from the list. 

2) If you want to "claim" a task (i.e. you plan on doing it shortly), 
   put your name in [square brackets] at the end of the event.

_Spamming_
  - When event is over, ask participants for feedback.
  
  - Participants are notified via email of change to core event information (agenda, location, time, status).
  
  - Participants are notified of reminder of event (eg, day before).
  
  - Owner is notified via email of RSVPs and comments.
  
  - All members are notified of new events.

_Other_
  - Owner can give event to another participant.
  
  - Event attributes (other than minutes) should be locked after event is completed

  - Export events to an iCalendar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file

  - Make forms prettier (i.e. make input sizes more appropriate)
  	- on Edit/New Event, when existing location is selected, alternative location
	  inputs can be greyed-out or dissapeared (via some Javascript magic).

  - Somewhere, it would be nice to have the SVN revision (maybe in the footer for each page).
    This way, we would be able to easily see what revision the dev.pdxruby.org is running.

  - Cache index page. How should this be done? Periodically or when some set of DB modifications
    occurs (i.e. when scripts/feeder runs, and when an event is added or deleted or modified). Ideally
    the index should be able to handle a slashdotting.

_Input Validation_
  - make sure email address and feed URL (for Member) look like an email address and URL

  - max length of each input should be less than or equal to length of corresponding database field
  
  - lots more not listed here...

_Testing_
  - this is a placeholder

_Feeds_
  - It would be nice if the feeds could be moderated by people. If one
    person posts a bunch of off-topic entries, then the last 5 isn't very
    Ruby-based. Currently, a user can delete his or her own articles, which is probably
    good-enough for a little while.

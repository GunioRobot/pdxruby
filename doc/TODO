Notes:

1) If you complete one of these, please remove it from the list. 

2) If you want to "claim" a task (i.e. you plan on doing it shortly), 
   put your name in [square brackets] at the end of the event.

_Spamming_
  - When event is over, ask participants for feedback.
  
  - Participants are notified via email of change to core event information (agenda, location, time, status).
  
  - Participants are notified of reminder of event (eg, day before).
  
  - Owner is notified via email of RSVPs and comments.
  
  - All members are notified of new events.

_Other_
  - Owner can give event to another participant.
  
  - Export events to an iCalendar (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICalendar) file

  - Make forms prettier (i.e. make input sizes more appropriate)
  	- on Edit/New Event, when existing location is selected, alternative location
	  inputs can be greyed-out or dissapeared (via some Javascript magic).

  - Somewhere, it would be nice to have the SVN revision (maybe in the footer for each page).
    This way, we would be able to easily see what revision the dev.pdxruby.org is running.
    	- the deploy script may make this unessicary
	- a post-commit hook that dumps the revision number into a file in /public/
	  would be one solution

  - Cache index page. How should this be done? Periodically or when some set of DB modifications
    occurs (i.e. when scripts/feeder runs, and when an event is added or deleted or modified). Ideally
    the index should be able to handle a slashdotting.

  - Some way for a user to reset/change their password

_Input Validation_
  - more??? can you think of any?

_Testing_
  - write functional tests for application.rb
  - write functional tests for articles_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for events_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for feedbacks_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for index_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for locations_controller.rb
  - write functional tests for participants_controller.rb
  - write unit tests for article.rb
  - write unit tests for event.rb
  - write unit tests for feedback.rb
  - write unit tests for location.rb
  - write unit tests for member.rb
  - write unit tests for participant.rb

_Feeds_
  - It would be nice if the feeds could be moderated by people. If one
    person posts a bunch of off-topic entries, then the last 5 isn't very
    Ruby-based. Currently, a user can delete his or her own articles, which is probably
    good-enough for a little while.
    	- Perhaps a field should be added to the articles relation
	  that contains the number of 'nay' votes. When some threshold
	  is reached, the article is not shown (but not deleted - if
	  it were, the feeder would just grab it again next run)

The following are behaviors that were left over from the initial codefest.  If you complete one
of these, please remove it from the list. If you want to "claim" a task (i.e. you plan on doing
it shortly), put your name in [square brackets] at the end of the event.

_Spamming_
  - When event is over, ask participants for feedback.
  
  - Participants are notified via email of change to core event information (agenda, location, time, status).
  
  - Participants are notified of reminder of event (eg, day before).
  
  - Owner is notified via email of RSVPs and comments.
  
  - All members are notified of new events.

_Other_
  - Owner can give event to another participant.
  
  - Event attributes (other than minutes) should be locked after event is completed

_Input Validation_
  - lots more not listed here...

_Testing_
  - this is a placeholder

_Feeds_

  - It would be nice if the feeds could be moderated by people. If one
    person posts a bunch of off-topic entries, then the last 5 isn't very
    Ruby-based.

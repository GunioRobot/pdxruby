RSS feed support requires an additional component, the 'feeder'. To run it, just
execute the following from the root dir of the project:

ruby scripts/feeder

By default, this script will poll each member's RSS feed (if they have one) once
every five minutes, remove any existing articles, and add the current contents
of their RSS feeds as separate Article instances.

It depends on the 'simple-rss' gem, and may well fail on some feeds.

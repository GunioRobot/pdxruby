RSS feed support requires an additional component, the 'feeder'. To run it, just
execute the following from the root dir of the project:

ruby scripts/feeder

By default, this script will poll each member's RSS feed (if they have one) once,
adding any articles that are new, updating any that have changed, and deleting
any that are no longer present. If you wish for the script to run continuously
(on some interval), this can be configured. Also, by default, it is fairly
verbose about it's task - if you prefer it to be quiet, this can also be
configured.

It depends on the 'simple-rss' gem, and may well fail on some feeds.

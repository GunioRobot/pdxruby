_Community Stuff_
  - del.icio.us aggregator.  Let members share their del username
    and fetch certain tags
  
  - provide an rss feed of our aggregated/combined feed data

  - provide an rss feed of events, and maybe an rss feed for
    the participations for an event

_UI Stuff_

  - "calender view" for events, perhaps week-at-a-time too
